                Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The ACS Control for Window Phone allows your phone applications to outsource user
                authentication to the Windows Azure Access Control Service (ACS). This service,
                enables your users to log in by reusing their existing accounts from identity providers
                such as Windows Live ID, Google, Yahoo, Facebook and possibly from their Active
                Directory. If you want to know more about ACS, you can take a look at the dedicated
                hands-on labs in the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/gg271268">Windows Azure Platform
                    Training Course</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This package provides a Silverlight Control for Windows Phone to interact with ACS,
                that you can include in your Windows Phone applications to take care of all the
                runtime interactions with this service. Additionally, this package includes a base
                log in page that uses this control and it is ready to be used in your phone application.
                All that is left to do for you is to configure your ACS namespace via its handy
                management portal (like specifying your preferences such as the identity providers
                you want to enable in your relying party), and integrate the log in page into your
                existing Windows Phone application.

            <h3>
                Prerequisites</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://www.nuget.org/">NuGet 1.5 or above</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=27570">Windows Phone

            <h2>
                Configuration</h2>
            <h3>
                Configuring your ACS namespace settings</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>First of all, make sure to have a Windows Azure Access Control Service (ACS) namespace
                    with a fully configured Relying Party Application to receive a Simple Web Token
                    (SWT).</li>
                <li>After that, you need to configure your ACS namespace settings so they can be used
                    by the control. To do this, go to the <strong>Resources</strong> folder and open
                    the <strong>AccessControlResources.xaml</strong> file.</li>
                <li>In this file, replace the <strong>youracsnamespace</strong> and <strong>yourrealm</strong>
                    placeholders with your <strong>ACS namespace</strong> and your <strong>Relying Party
                        realm</strong> respectively.</li>
                <br />

            </ol>

            <h3>
                Integrating the base log in page 
                with your Windows Phone application</h3>
                <p>This package includes a base log in page that uses the ACS Control for Windows Phone
                    to allow users to authenticate using their favorite identity provider. In order to integrate this page with your Windows Phone 
                    application navigation flow review the following steps.</p>
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Take into account when designing the navigation logic and flow of your Windows Phone application,
                that pressing the device's <strong>Back</strong> button from the first screen of your application <strong>must</strong> close the application.
                Otherwise, your application will not be accepted in the Windows Phone Marketplace.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Make sure to link to the <strong>/Pages/LoginPage.xaml</strong> page from an existing page in your application, or, alternately, 
                set it as the default page for your application in the <strong>WMAppManifest.xml</strong> file as is shown in the following image.</li>
                <br />
                <img src="Content/LoginPage-WMAppManifest.png" title="Setting the log in page as default in the WMAppManifest.xml file" /><br />
                <br />
                <li>Once the page is included in your navigation flow, you need to replace the <strong>TODO</strong>
                    comments in the <strong>Pages/LoginPage.xaml.cs</strong> file with your application
                    navigation logic. In the following picture, for example, you can see how to navigate
                    to another page only when the user is correctly authenticated.</li>
                <br />

            <h2>
                Handling the token returned by the Identity Providers</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>The ACS Control for Window Phone automatically saves the Simple Web Token obtained
                    from the selected identity provider to the phone&#39;s Isolated Storage and makes
                    it available to your application as an application resource called <strong>swtStore</strong>.</li>
                <li>The only claim type supported out-of-the-box for all the built-team identity provides in Windows Azure
                    Access Control Service is the <strong>NameIdentifier</strong>. To access the authenticated users'
                    NameIdentifier claim value, you can use the following snippet.</li>
                <pre class="code">
var simpleWebTokenStore = Application.Current.Resources["swtStore"] as SimpleWebTokenStore;

var userNameIdentifier = <strong>simpleWebTokenStore.SimpleWebToken.NameIdentifier</strong>;
</pre>
                <li>To access the rest of the user's claims, you can query
                    the <strong>Claims</strong> dictionary of the <strong>SimpleWebToken</strong> 
                    class, and extract the ones you require. For
                    instance, to access the value of the <strong>Name</strong> claim type, you can use the following snippet.</li>
                <pre class="code">
var simpleWebTokenStore = Application.Current.Resources["swtStore"] as SimpleWebTokenStore;

var name = <strong>simpleWebTokenStore.SimpleWebToken.Claims[ClaimTypes.Name];</strong></pre>
            </ol>
